    name: "Utilitarianism",
    description:
      "Utilitarianism suggests that the moral value of an action is determined by its ability to produce the greatest amount of happiness or pleasure for the greatest number of people. It's a way of thinking about right and wrong based on the consequences of our actions. The theory encourages us to make choices that maximize the overall amount of happiness or pleasure in the world and minimize the amount of suffering or pain. The founder of utilitarianism, Jeremy Bentham, believed that the principle of utility should be the guide for ethical decision-making, and that we should strive to create the most good for the most people.",

  deontology: {
    name: "Deontology",
    description:
      "Deontology suggests that the moral value of an action is determined by whether it is in accordance with certain rules or duties, rather than the consequences that may result. It's a way of thinking about right and wrong based on the rules or principles that we believe are inherently good or right. The theory encourages us to act based on our sense of duty or obligation, even if it may not lead to the best outcomes. Deontologists believe that some actions are always right or wrong, regardless of the circumstances, and that we have a responsibility to act in accordance with these moral principles.",
    trolleySolution:
      "A deontologist might believe that it is always wrong to intentionally take a human life, regardless of the consequences, and would refuse to take any action that would directly cause harm to any person, even if it means that more people may die as a result.",

  virtueEthics: {
    name: "Virtue Ethics",
    description:
      "Virtue ethics suggests that the moral value of an action is determined by the character traits or virtues that it reflects. It's a way of thinking about right and wrong based on the kind of person we want to become, rather than following rules or achieving certain outcomes. The theory encourages us to develop good habits and virtues, such as courage, honesty, and compassion, that will guide our actions in different situations. Virtue ethicists believe that being a good person is the key to leading a fulfilling and happy life, and that we should strive to become the best versions of ourselves by cultivating these character traits.",
    trolleySolution:
      "A virtue ethicist might take into consideration the character traits that the decision to act or not act in a given situation reflects. They might choose the action that best exemplifies virtues such as courage, compassion, or justice, in line with the kind of person they aim to become.",

    name: "Ethical Egoism",
    description:
      "Ethical egoism suggests that the moral value of an action is determined by how much it benefits the person who is taking the action. It's a way of thinking about right and wrong based on self-interest, rather than the interests of others. The theory encourages us to act in ways that promote our own self-interest, even if it may not benefit others. Ethical egoists believe that individuals have a duty to prioritize their own happiness and well-being over the happiness and well-being of others, and that this is the best way to achieve a fulfilling life.",
    trolleySolution:
      "An ethical egoist might prioritize their own self-interest and choose the option that minimizes their own negative consequences, regardless of the impact on others. They might choose the option that ensures their own happiness, even if it means sacrificing the happiness of others.",
    keyProponents: [
