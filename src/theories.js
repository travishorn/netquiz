    description:
      "Categorical Imperative is a central concept in the moral philosophy of Immanuel Kant, a prominent 18th-century German philosopher. Simply put, it is a moral principle that states that we should only act in ways that we can will to be universal laws of conduct. In other words, we should only do things that we would be willing for everyone to do in similar circumstances, without contradiction or inconsistency. Kant believed that this principle provides a rational basis for morality that is independent of personal desires or circumstances, and that it is binding on all rational beings.",

      "In this theory, individuals should always be treated as ends in themselves and never merely as means to an end. Therefore, they would navigate situations by prioritizing moral consistency and respect for human dignity, and would likely avoid actions that intentionally cause harm to others, even if it means accepting a suboptimal outcome.",

    description:
      "Contractualism is a moral theory that emphasizes the importance of social agreements and mutual obligations as the foundation of moral norms. According to contractualism, moral rules are created through a hypothetical agreement among rational individuals who seek to cooperate with each other and promote their common interests. This agreement is based on the idea that people should be treated with equal respect and concern, and that their fundamental rights and interests should be protected. Contractualism aims to provide a basis for morality that is both impartial and responsive to social and historical circumstances, and that can guide our actions in a complex and pluralistic world.",
    problemNavigation:
      "In this theory, moral principles are those that would be agreed upon by rational agents in a hypothetical contract or social agreement. Therefore, they would navigate situations by considering the principles of fairness, reciprocity, and respect for individuals' autonomy. A contractualist would seek a solution that maximizes the overall well-being of all parties involved while respecting their individual rights and interests, and would make decisions based on what a group of rational agents would agree upon in a hypothetical contract.",

According to this theory, moral reasoning should focus on the specific context of relationships and the practical demands of caring for others, rather than on abstract principles or rules. Ethics of Care places a high value on empathy, compassion, and responsiveness to the needs of others, particularly those who are vulnerable or marginalized. It also emphasizes the importance of addressing systemic issues and social inequalities that can undermine caring relationships and limit the ability of individuals to flourish.",

According to this view, reason and knowledge are fundamental to understanding the world and achieving our goals and values, and they provide a basis for moral and practical decision-making. Intellectualists believe that rationality is a universal and objective standard that can guide our behavior, and that education and the pursuit of knowledge are essential for human flourishing. They also tend to place a high value on critical thinking and skepticism, and may be critical of traditional beliefs and authority. Intellectualism has been influential in fields such as ethics, epistemology, and political philosophy.",

These rights are typically seen as universal and inalienable, meaning that they cannot be taken away or surrendered by individuals or governments. Examples of such rights may include the right to life, liberty, property, and freedom of speech and religion. Natural Rights Theory is often associated with the work of Enlightenment philosophers such as John Locke and Thomas Jefferson, and it has been influential in the development of modern liberalism and human rights discourse.",

Preference Utilitarianism differs from other forms of Utilitarianism in that it focuses on the satisfaction of individuals' actual preferences, rather than on some objective measure of happiness or pleasure. Preference Utilitarianism also allows for individual differences in values and goals, and acknowledges that some preferences may be more important than others. The goal of this approach is to promote the greatest overall satisfaction of individuals' preferences, while avoiding actions that would frustrate or harm others.",

Role Ethics recognizes the importance of context and the complexity of moral decision-making, and seeks to provide a more nuanced and realistic account of morality than other theories that rely on abstract principles or rules.
