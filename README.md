# Normative Ethical Theory Quiz

Based on the tongue-in-cheek quiz by Oliver Lugg in his video [FTL: Trolley
Problems in Space (Video Game
Analysis)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2HpA5u5qKc).

One of the main areas of Philosophical Ethics is called Normative Ethics. Here,
we choose the factors we value in making decisions.

By teasing out the reasons why we make a decision, we can better define right
and wrong to improve our understanding of complex situations.

Normative Ethics is all about determining the intrinsic factors - figuring out
the most basic reasons why an action or rule has ethical force. Whatever
conclusion you come to is considered a Normative Theory.

This quiz asks questions and then shows which Normative Ethical Theory the
answerer most aligns with.
